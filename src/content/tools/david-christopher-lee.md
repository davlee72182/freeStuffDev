David Christopher Lee has always been a gifted person and a pioneer since he was a young child. His father was a mathematician. Academia ran in his blood. David was labeled a child prodigy by his teachers, winning statewide writing competitions as young as 8 years old. David’s abilities didn’t end there. He was a pianist, playing concertos by Bach, Mozart, and Shostakovich with the USC orchestra at the age of 16, garnering many awards from piano competitons. Graduating 4th in his high school class, David was accepted into UC Berkeley and graduated two years early due to AP classes he took in high school.

In 1999, when the photographer world was only film, he became the first official digital photographer of the Teen Choice Awards, MTV Movie Awards, Billboard Music Awards and found a passion for the entertainment industry. 

He has worked in over 40 Countries and has developed an innovative international style of his own. He started his first online magazine called TDink.com in 2001 and was the first to publish fashion editorials online. As a young publisher, he had access to the most incredible events and innovators of the world. In 2009, he started Destinationluxury.com which became one of the largest portals for all things luxury including 5 star properties, Michelin Star Restaurants and bespoke experiences.			

As a portrait photographer and producer, David has worked with many celebrities & major brands such as Richard Branson, Lady Gaga, Cadillac, Lexus, Qatar Airways, Aman Hotels, just to name a few.

David’s work has been published in major magazines such as GQ, Vogue, Instyle, People, Teen, Men’s Health, Departures & many more.

In 2020, David started a site called thebiohack.org which is about health, wellness, biohacking, and anti-aging. When covid began and all the parties stopped, he found a new passion for holistic healing and pushed his body to the limits mentally and physically. He transformed his body in 6 months and has a totally new outlook on life. David's best ideas come to him when he meditates daily for 2 to 3 hours. He loves biking, skiing, and exploring. Work and play are the same to him, as long as he is broadening his horizons, challenging himself, and going outside of his comfort zone.
